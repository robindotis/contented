# A simple yet powerful script to generate great websites.

I've documented my home brew php site generation script to encourage building, hosting and managing independent blogs over the use of common blogging services. 

Why yet another script? The more independent tools there are for creating websites, the more means of expression we have and the more ways of thinking are encouraged. 

[Get started here](/docs/).

Or view the [script on GitHub](https://github.com/robindotis/docs.robin.is/blob/main/index.php).
