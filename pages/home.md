# Contented Web

## A simple script to generate easy to use websites.

The idea behind ***Contented*** ðŸ•¸ is to encourage building, hosting and managing independent blogs over the use one of the common blogging services. 

Why yet another blogging tool? The more independent tools there are, the more means of expression we have and the more ways of thinking are encouraged.
