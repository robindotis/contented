This is an example accessibility statement. DIY Blog is designed to be accessible.

## Compliance status

This website is fully compliant with [WCAG 2 Level AA](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG2/) when using the **default** or **high contrast** themes. Other themes may have accessibility issues, usually due to insufficient contrast.

### Explanation

No web accessibiltiy law directly applies to this site. Nevertheless, since I live in the European Union, I try to ensure the site meets the relevant requirements of these two pieces of European Union legislation.

* The [Web Accessibiliy Directive](https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/web-accessibility) - ([Directive (EU) 2016/2102](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/dir/2016/2102/oj)).
* The [European Accessibility Act](https://ec.europa.eu/social/main.jsp?catId=1202) - ([Directive (EU) 2019/882](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/dir/2019/882/oj)).

Both these directives rely on the harmonised European standard [EN 301 549 v3.2.1 on the "Accessibility requirements for ICT products and services"](https://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_en/301500_301599/301549/03.02.01_60/en_301549v030201p.pdf) as a way of developing websites that meet the requirements of the legisation.

For the purposes of a basic website such as this one, the requirements of that standard are the same as those of the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines published by the [W3C's Web Accessibility Initiative](https://www.w3.org/WAI/).

## Non-accessible content

There is no non-accessible content on this website.

## Preparation of this accessibility statement

The next review is scheduled for January 2026.

## Enforcement procedure
